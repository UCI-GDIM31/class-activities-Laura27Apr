The reason that r, g, b variables floats is that the color section in the Unity is set from 0 to 1.0, therefore the value will be fractional number instead of whole numbers, text or true/false decision;
The bounce variable should be the whole number because there will not be any bounce times like 0.5. And of course the value of the bounce cannot be the text or true/false decision;
For the step four, the useful information is that this line need to add the semicolon to make this line completed.

We would make the parameter (input) "int" since the choice is based on the player¡¯s current friendship level, which is a whole number value; and the return type (output) would be "boolean" since the requirements of this step is that to make the response "tells you whether or not", which is a true/false judgement.

1. Classes are like the ingredients of a plate to make a cake. and the Component is the cake. We use ingredients (classes) to make and form the cake (Component).
2. This is because as the ball bounces again and again, the times the ball multiplies the GetColorMultiplier again and again. In this scenario, this value increases exponentially, and the ball's brightness grows ever brighter.
